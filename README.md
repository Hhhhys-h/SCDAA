# SCDAA
We put the definition of classes and functions in the xx document, to make the process more clearly, markdowns are included with some necessary explanations. You can view all details of our code here and check how we work to solving the problems. The graphs and results are shown in the xx document, you browse the results here or copy the code you want to run separately. To help you better call the code, we will introduce the functions necessary to adjust variables and output results.

**Exercise 1.1：**
Function xx is provided for setting T and time grid. The default value for both T and time grid is 10000 and you can initialised the value here.
```
T and time grid
```

**Exercise 1.2：**
To run the functions and get the convergence of time steps and Monte Carlo sample, you can copy and run the code below:
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main_exercise1_1()
```

**Exercise 2.1：**

**Exercise 3.1：**

**Exercise 4.1：**

**Exercise 5.1：**
