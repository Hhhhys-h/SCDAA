# SCDAA
We put the definition of classes and functions in the xx document, to make the process clearer, markdowns are included with some necessary explanations. You can view all details of our code here and check how we work to solve the problems. The graphs and results are shown in the xx document, you can browse the results here or copy the code you want to run separately. To help you better call the code, we will introduce the functions necessary to adjust variables and output results.

**Exercise 1.1：Solving LQR using from Ricatti ODE**

Function xx is provided for setting T and the time grid. The default value for both T and time grid is 10000, and you can initialise the value here.
```
T and time grid
```

**Exercise 1.2：LQR MC checks**

To run the functions and get the convergence of time steps and Monte Carlo samples, you can copy and run the code below:
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main_exercise1_2()
```

**Exercise 2.1：Solving soft LQR**

To plot the figure of controlled trajectories for the strict LQR and relaxed LQR from four different starting points, you can run the code below:
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main_exercise2()
```

**Exercise 3.1：Critic algorithm**

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main_exercise3()
```

**Exercise 4.1：Actor algorithm**
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main_exercise1_4()
```
**Exercise 5.1：Actor-critic algorithm**
```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main_exercise1_5()
```
